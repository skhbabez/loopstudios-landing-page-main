## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Web framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I decided to try out astro for this challenge. This framework was surprisingly easy to pick up and I am probably going to use this for future projects again sometimes.

### Continued development

I almost forgot about this project due to some others courses I took. I will probably give it another pass after some time, especially considering accessibility.
